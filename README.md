# Pathfinder: Evaluating Visual Robustness of Object Detectors under Sensor Degradation

_(Repository: `pathfinder-vision-robustness`)_

> _A research-style Computer Vision project for Emory University and Georgia Tech Robotics + CV + RL labs._

### üß≠ Overview

Real-world robotic vision often suffers from imperfect sensors‚Äîblur, fog, low light, or noise.  
**Pathfinder** examines how modern object detectors (YOLOv8, DETR, SAM) perform under such degradation and explores lightweight methods to restore robustness.

**Keywords:** Computer Vision ‚Ä¢ Robotics ‚Ä¢ Sensor Degradation ‚Ä¢ Robust Perception
